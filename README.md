# Classifieds  
Classifieds is an in-office or in-organisational application which supports exchange of goods between employees in monetary terms. This repo includes all the Web API's developed for that application purpose.  
  * Classifieds.App.API contains the controllers.  
  * Classifieds.App.Models contain the DB Models.  
  * Classifieds.App.ViewModels contain the view models for the mobile front-end.  
  * Classifieds.App.Services contains the repositories to access the data from the db.  
    
  This project uses Entity FrameWork Core to interact with the database and follows a repository design pattern.
