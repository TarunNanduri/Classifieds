  * <a href="https://github.com/TarunNanduri/Classifieds/tree/master/Classifieds.App.Models">Classifieds.App.Models</a> contain the DB Models.  
  * <a href="https://github.com/TarunNanduri/Classifieds/tree/master/Classifieds.App.Services">Classifieds.App.ViewModels</a> contains the repositories to access the data from the db.
    
  This project uses Entity FrameWork Core to interact with the database and follows a repository design pattern.
